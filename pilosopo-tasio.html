    <blockquote>"Knowledge and progress cannot flourish in a society ruled by fear and blind obedience" - Pilosopo Tasyo (Chapter 14)</blockquote>

    <h2>End Status</h2>
    <p>By the novel's conclusion, Pilosopo Tasyo passes away, symbolizing the tragic loss of intellectualism and the unfulfilled hopes for reform under Spanish colonial rule.</p>

    <h2>Symbolism</h2>
    <p>Pilosopo Tasyo embodies the marginalized intellectual elite of the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period. His character illustrates the struggle between reason and superstition, progress and tradition, and the isolation faced by visionaries ahead of their time. Through Tasyo, Jos√© Rizal highlights the challenges that those seeking reform encounter in a society resistant to change, a message that continues to resonate with Filipinos facing similar issues today.</p>
