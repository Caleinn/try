        <h1>Betrayal and Redemption: The Journey Of Ibarra In Noli Me Tangere</h1>
        
        <p>Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra y Magsalin is the central figure and novelistic main protagonist, one half Spanish and Filipino, a young and educated man returning to his home country after studying in Europe. He found out that his father, Don Rafael, was in prison because he was suspected of subversive activities and thus perished. However, it was not before Ibarra tried to start a secular school in San Diego to continue what his father envisioned, and when the corrupt officials and Spanish priests, Father Salvi, conspired against him to make him out as a revolutionary, per se, spoiling his plans. Crisostomo was struggling, which symbolized him in reform or revolution, as he established a system that, unfortunately, they were deemed subversive.</p>
        
        <p>Crisostomo was called names due to his staging insurrection coming from his enemies with the involvement of Padre Salvi. Someone showed shaky evidence against him, sad to say, his fiancée betrayed him for her family's sake. But then, he escaped from jail with the help of Elias, he then confronts Maria Clara with a straight face, making her explain that betrayal display. His escape with Elias made the Guardia Civil search for him; tragedy waits for both characters. After that, it was convinced that Ibarra's death, Maria Clara went to the convent and told Padre Damaso to postpone the wedding. The fate of Sisa's mother who lost her sons and there with her mind—and that of Ibarra and Maria Clara themselves only a symbol of the great masses of the Philippine people under colonial domination, suffering and beautiful.</p>

        <h1>Basilio: The Embodiment of Youth Hope and Resilience</h1>
        
        <p>Basilio is one of the compelling characters in Noli Me Tangere. He is the son of Sisa and the brother of Crispin. Even as a child, Basilio experienced too much suffering. His brother Crispin falsely accused of theft, was tortured by the church and authorities, and died. His mother became mad due to Crispin and later died due to negligence. Basilio became orphaned and wandered alone in his life. Just what kind of symbolism does Dr. Jose Rizal intend Basilio to be?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"I will not allow my mother's death to be in vain. I will work hard to become a doctor so that I can help others who suffer as she did" (Rizal, 1996).</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>After watching his brother taken away and died, followed by his mother's descent into madness and death, Basilio continued his life with hope and resilience, without forgetting his past. Even after experiencing injustices, instead of revenge, Basilio instead wants to help the people who experienced the same as him.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"I will fight for justice; I will not stay silent in the face of oppression" (Rizal, 1996).</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>With all his suffering, Basilio craved for justice through legal and good moral way.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Someday, I will find a way to ease the suffering of my people. I will not allow their pain to go unnoticed" (Rizal, 1996).</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>After his suffering in life, Basilio didn't just continue life with hope and resilience but also harbored a dream for his people.</p>
        
        <p>Overall, Basilio is the very incarnate of Rizal's idea of hope, resilience, and what youth should be. Rizal hoped that through this character Filipinos, especially the youth, should always face life with hope and resilience. After all, Rizal envisioned that the youth are the country's hope.</p>

        <h1>Pilosopo Tasyo: The Awakening of Filipino Consciousness Against Spanish Injustice</h1>
        
        <p>Pilosopo Tasyo is one of the characters in Dr. Jose Rizal's Noli Me Tangere. Considered the mad philosopher of his town, Pilosopo Tasyo is an old man who acts eccentric, yet he genuinely has wisdom and knowledge. He is a former priest that leaves the church in search of truth. Throughout the story of Noli Me Tangere, he can be seen giving advice to various characters, especially Crisostomo Ibarra. But what does Dr. Rizal want Tasyo to be?</p>
        
        <p>During Dr. Rizal's time, Spanish colonized the Philippines. Many Filipinos were abused, enslaved, raped, and even killed. Rizal wrote the novel Noli Me Tangere in hopes of awakening the spirits of Filipinos and to fight against the tyranny of the Spanish church and government. The novel has a sequel named El Filibusterismo. Dr. Rizal's novels essentially show how to change society and how not to do a revolution. Many characters in Noli Me Tangere symbolize people, organizations, society, and even the Philippines itself. Pilosopo Tasyo symbolizes Filipinos who awaken themselves to reality and seek the truth.</p>
        
        <p>Pilosopo Tasyo is a priest who leaves the church in search of truth. This transformation of him symbolizes the Filipinos who have rekindled their nationalistic spirit. "There is no greater enemy to the truth than ignorance" (Rizal, 2011). Dr. Rizal even pointed out that what Pilosopo Tasyo did was basically to open our eyes to see what really is happening. We often get blinded by our greed and personal wants. But Pilosopo Tasyo, on the other hand, abandoned his faith in search of truth. "You must ask questions, and you should question" (Rizal, 2011). This shows that Dr. Rizal's aim is not just to reveal what the Spaniards are doing to us but also to highlight what our society has become. It underscores the importance of the sacrifice and effort needed to not only see what is happening but also to understand it. "A nation that does not study is a nation that does not progress" (Rizal, 2011). Dr. Rizal wants Filipinos to take Pilosopo Tasyo as a message to seek the truth actively.</p>
        
        <p>In conclusion, Pilosopo Tasyo symbolizes the awakening of Filipinos to Spanish injustices. His character serves as a message for us to actively seek truth, even if that makes us eccentric to society. Dr. Rizal uses Pilosopo Tasyo as a medium for his hidden message to us Filipinos that it's up to us how we face our past so we can understand our present and make the future better.</p>

        <h1>Elias: Rizal's Timeless Symbol of Revolution and Justice</h1>

        <h2>The Symbolism of Elias in Noli Me Tangere</h2>
        
        <p>In José Rizal's novel Noli Me Tangere, the character Elias represents the Philippines' fight against Spanish colonialism and the pursuit of social justice. Elias' altruism and loyalty to his fellow citizens serve as a striking condemnation of the societal inequalities common during colonial rule. His persona depicts the internal difficulties that Filipinos endure while negotiating their identities in the face of foreign dominance, highlighting the importance of perseverance and optimism in the face of persecution (Rizal, 2012).</p>
        
        <p>Rizal designed Elias specifically to represent the prospect of change and the fight for a brighter future. His sad fate serves as a sobering reminder of the sacrifices made by those who defy the status quo. Rizal emphasizes the need for empathy and compassion in the pursuit of justice through Elias' cryptic character and profound understanding of the Filipino experience (De Leon, 2001; Guerrero, 1998), proving that true heroism is found in selfless deeds of courage.</p>
        
        <p>Elias is a timeless figure in Noli Me Tangere, embodying the Filipino people's eternal spirit and pursuit of justice. His persona represents the ambitions and aspirations of individuals seeking freedom in the face of injustice. Through Elias, Rizal depicts the complicated nature of Filipino identity during a period of colonial rule, stressing resistance and togetherness. His symbolism extends beyond the novel, challenging readers to consider their responsibilities in campaigning for social justice and becoming active participants in the battle against structural injustices. Finally, Rizal's portrayal of Elias serves as a compelling call to action, reminding us that the fight for justice necessitates bravery, compassion, and steadfast commitment to the greater good (Rizal, 2012).</p>
